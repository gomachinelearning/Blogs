We have to ensure every worker called back on the job has access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing and effective personal protective equipment. https://t.co/lDPQP3jZkwWe need a president who will fight to further LGBTQ+ equality — not roll back the hard-won progress we've already made.We need real policing reform — and we need it now. https://t.co/HkBvD8QsmLOur nation is at an inflection point. We can't go back to the way things were before — we have to take a bold step forward and usher in a new era of equality and opportunity.

We can do it, together.Here's my promise to you: I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our nation — not use them for political gain.

We shouldn’t accept anything less from an American president. https://t.co/I0r60NW4SUWe need a national ban on chokeholds. Now.I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. That is truer today than ever. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation.
 
We can’t let that happen.In light of Donald Trump's inhumane reversal of protections for transgender people, I want to share a conversation I had a few weeks ago. Adi deserves to be treated with the same respect and dignity as anyone else. Period. https://t.co/nr1u0vOvogOn the fourth anniversary of Pulse.
In the middle of Pride month.
During a global pandemic.

Donald Trump's cruelty truly knows no bounds. We have to defeat him this November. https://t.co/YAy4ZGxxyDTwo years after Trump's Singapore meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the U.S. and our allies are less safe and Kim's arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles keeps growing. Photo-ops and love letters are no substitute for deterrence and principled diplomacy. https://t.co/YfaCdlwJ8SMedgar Evers once said, "freedom has never been free." On this day in 1963, he paid the ultimate price in pursuit of freedom for his brothers and sisters. He was gunned down fighting to end racial injustice. We must honor him by carrying forward that cause in our own lives today.Four years ago today, 49 lives were cut short in an act of unspeakable terrorism at Pulse nightclub. As we remember those we lost — including so many in the LGBTQ+ and Hispanic communities — we have to double down on our efforts to #HonorThemWithAction. https://t.co/TKaZ4M7IFFWe need real policing reform, and we need it now. Congress should immediately:

- Outlaw chokeholds
- Improve oversight and accountability
- Create a model use of force standard
- Stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forcesDonald Trump forgot about COVID-19, but COVID-19 didn’t forget about us. 

The President couldn’t wish away the virus in April, he couldn’t tweet it away in May, and he can’t ignore it away in June.Our country is crying out for leadership that Donald Trump can’t deliver. https://t.co/QHvUdgg6IoWe need a president who chooses hope over fear.We can't let history repeat itself — Facebook needs to act now to stop the spread of disinformation and protect our elections. Watch my deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield break down what's happening and how you can help us fix it: https://t.co/WYMMAWkuLZ https://t.co/OGG2wwtW2PCOVID-19 can affect anyone, anywhere — but it doesn't impact every community equally. Watch as Dr. Ebony Jade Hilton explains how it’s impacting communities of color: https://t.co/3uuXEsfyv4While the president was spiking the football and taking a victory lap, another 1.5 million Americans filed new unemployment claims last week.
 
He is completely oblivious to what's really happening in this country — and hardworking Americans are paying the price. https://t.co/AglBowCtKcWe have to ensure our economic reopening is safe and strong — and builds the foundation for an economy that works for everyone. Today, I'm releasing my plan to make that happen: https://t.co/v6hImc0J3qWe have to make sure our economic reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in for a roundtable discussion on how we can make that happen: https://t.co/7WIbtob6WEWe have to make sure our economic reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in for a roundtable discussion on how we can make that happen: https://t.co/lWNMjkTf06With less than 150 days until Election Day, the stakes couldn't be higher. We've got to fix Facebook to protect our democracy and ensure fair elections.
 
If you agree, sign the open letter today to demand Facebook take action. #MoveFastFixIt https://t.co/6Hmta4UxS9So far, Facebook has failed to enact any real reforms to stop the spread of disinformation on its platform. Time is running out.
 
Today, we're releasing an open letter demanding the company change its policies: https://t.co/S1WIQTsfELFolks, we saw in 2016 what can happen when social media platforms are left unchecked and allow disinformation to run rampant. It puts the very integrity of our elections at risk.
 
We simply cannot let it happen again in 2020.It's in our darkest moments that we've produced some of our greatest progress — and we have that opportunity once again. Let's make this a moment of action to address systemic racism and propel our nation into an era of true equality and opportunity.There is systemic racism not just in our law enforcement but also in housing, education, and everything we do — and we have to do the hard work to end it. https://t.co/w9H77JbuqaWe have to make this an era of action — starting with real police reform. No more excuses. No more delays.
 
Add your name to demand Congress ban chokeholds — and pass real police reform — right now: https://t.co/Sa6sPy2BtSThis pandemic isn't just going to go away because you want it to, Mr. President. Step up and do your job before your negligence costs even more lives than it already has. https://t.co/L6QfV31eFQIgnore the polls. We can't take anything for granted this November — the stakes are simply too high.

Let's get to work. https://t.co/gI5KfaGsYINothing about the fights we're facing will be easy. Racism has been a fixture in our society for hundreds of years. 
 
But I’m ready to get to work on day one. We can’t accept anything less from an American president.Donald Trump’s hate-filled, conspiracy-laden rhetoric is inflaming the racial divides in our country—but just fixing the way the president talks won’t cut it. We need to root out systemic racism and ensure Black Americans have a real shot to get ahead. https://t.co/FhgRNPjKR8America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. We’ve never fully lived up to that promise — and we can’t rest until we finally do.From ballot shortages and issues with machines to hours-long lines — what happened today in Georgia should enrage us all. We need to act now to prevent it from happening again in November. Our democracy depends on it. https://t.co/LLhBr8qVQwBecause of Donald Trump's negligence and incompetence:
 
- More than 110,000 people have died
- We have nearly 2 million cases of COVID-19
- Over 20 million Americans are out of work
 
And yet he’s patting himself on the back. Unbelievable.Small businesses like Rafael's are the backbone of communities all across this nation. We have to do so much more to help them through this crisis. https://t.co/msi1oZ6P24RT @GeorgiaDemocrat: Problems or questions related to voting in Georgia's primary election today? Just give us a call at 888-730-5816. http…Let me be clear: We can't leave this moment and once again turn away and do nothing.
 
We need justice. We need action. We need reform.Grief is a heavy burden to bear — and it's even harder with the eyes of the world watching. I know. But that burden is now a purpose — to change the world for the better in the name of George Floyd.

That's the message I shared with his loved ones during today's service: https://t.co/2LKJzwBUSOMy Dad used to say there's no greater sin than the abuse of power.

Whether it's an officer bloodying a peaceful protester or a President defending him with a conspiracy theory he saw on TV.

I'm a Catholic – just like Martin. Our faith says that we can't accept either.13 million people who had jobs when you took office are unemployed today. https://t.co/ofW1fjXe3ITogether, let’s make this an era of action. https://t.co/JHt3sELUCVThis moment is a wake-up call for all of us. It's long past time we deal with systemic racism, growing economic inequality, and the denial of the promise of this nation to so many. https://t.co/IV4EVWAfRODonald Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in history from the Obama-Biden Administration, but like everything else he’s inherited, he has squandered it. https://t.co/395A6eJAzmTo everyone speaking out and peacefully demanding justice across the nation: I see you, I hear you, and I stand with you. https://t.co/gsqiDcEZUoAt every turn, President Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and misled the American people — and we’re all paying the price every single day. https://t.co/klaYVm3gpYWe've made incredible progress on LGBTQ+ equality, but we still have further to go. We can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law—regardless of who they are or whom they love.

Join #OutForBiden and let's get to work: https://t.co/UMiuglr9XX https://t.co/hHNVoCU2q5We're facing some of the greatest challenges in our history, and Donald Trump is patting himself on the back. He just has no idea what’s really going on in this country.
 
It's time for him to step out of his bunker and look around at the consequences of his words and actions.American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending. But we have the power to write the future we want for this nation.

Don't let anyone tell you differently.Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.Our nation is at an inflection point. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics — or we can take the next great step forward. https://t.co/AbLAYAUsZxThese disparities have plagued our nation for far too long. It’s time we rebuild our country upon more just and equal foundations — and finally close race-based wealth and income gaps. https://t.co/KforFaypAPWe need to build an economy that rewards work — not just wealth. https://t.co/NANxlpk538This isn’t about politics. This is about the future of our country. Grateful for your support, Secretary Powell. https://t.co/0xLPyXiIPbThe words of a president matter. And time and time again, Donald Trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart.
 
We cannot give him another four years in the White House.We need to stand up as a nation — with the Black community and with all minority communities — and come together as one America. Because the pain is too immense for one community to bear alone.
 
It is the duty of every American to grapple with it — and grapple with it now.I promised George Floyd's family that he wouldn’t just become another hashtag — and I intend to keep that promise.
 
We need justice. And we need real police reform to ensure this never occurs again.To all those families who are scared, and hurting, and wondering what’s going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I won’t ever forget you. And I won’t be satisfied until this economy starts working for all of you. https://t.co/YxQ2OaeSyQToday, we honor those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, on the beachheads of Normandy. We must be a living memorial to their bravery and sacrifice—and recognize always that our strength is rooted in our fervid and unfailing defense of democratic rights and freedoms. #DDayToday, the pain is so raw it can be hard to keep faith that justice is at hand or that we will ever achieve the more perfect union we all want. But ours is a union worth fighting for, and we are all called to the cause. 

No one can stay silent. https://t.co/nZjQdJGKbDWe're just 150 days out from Election Day, and the stakes have never been higher. We have to defeat Donald Trump, and once we do, we won’t just rebuild this country — we'll transform it. Together.
 
Help us make it happen: https://t.co/AflPBScS1LDonald Trump was warned, but he failed to act. Now more than 20 million Americans are out of a job and paying the price. It didn’t have to be this bad. https://t.co/Hut7pquZUU150 days.Folks, tonight we secured the 1,991 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. I'm going to spend every day fighting to earn your vote so that, together, we can win the battle for the soul of this nation. https://t.co/sl3wFGabpgTonight, I’m thinking of Breonna Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer. Today should have been her daughter's birthday. I've talked a lot about turning pain into purpose. But for Breonna and Tamika, it’s on us to find purpose. Our country needs to act — now. https://t.co/Ql2SyMew76Donald Trump still doesn’t get it. He’s out there spiking the football — completely oblivious to the tens of millions of people who are facing the greatest struggle of their lives. https://t.co/ZNbTRsdVdSThis #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, I am reflecting on the life of Hadiya Pendleton, whose murder inspired the #WearOrange movement.

The hard truth is that Black Americans are ten times more likely to die by gun homicide. It has to stop.When it comes to this economic crisis, Donald Trump either doesn’t know what’s going on, or he just doesn’t care. https://t.co/db8axnf704Donald Trump is dangerously unfit to lead our nation through this moment. But don't just take my word for it: https://t.co/eD9z51pXDQLet’s be clear about something: The depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of God — but to the failure of a President.George Floyd’s last words, “I can’t breathe,” have echoed across our nation and around the world.

For the President to try to put any other words in his mouth is frankly despicable. https://t.co/8dWu78dtGPTune in as I speak about the latest jobs report and the state of the economy: https://t.co/pfELb1jmqaThose who have worked the closest with Donald Trump know how unfit he is to serve as President. https://t.co/MQ7aOKGic0It is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all of our people.We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.
 
We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us.
 
We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.We can’t take four more years of this.To everyone struggling with mental health—you're not alone. There is no shame in seeking help, and there shouldn't be any barriers in your way to getting that help.
 
Together, we can achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma. https://t.co/QXplsIwYTLIt's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. And I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.We are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists.RT @TeamJoe: We have to speak up  — be a voice for the voiceless and fight for what our communities need.

We have to carry on. https://t.c…Jim Mattis and I haven’t always agreed on everything, but you'd be hard pressed to find a more powerful indictment of Trump's actions and character than the one he's written. 
"We do not need to militarize our response to protests. We need to unite around a common purpose." https://t.co/T0F5TEjwqeI wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.

It's up to all of us to create the America we know we can be. https://t.co/LNI2e3d3lzMore than 42 million Americans have now filed for unemployment in the last three months, and Black and Latino communities are being hit hardest. https://t.co/qXnKEf1JMFThere’s no time to waste — we need to get to work immediately on real police reform. Congressman @Hakeem_Jeffries has a bill to outlaw chokeholds. Congress should put it on President Trump’s desk in the next few days. Period. https://t.co/w8XkHwFcBtThe nation is crying out for leadership — but this president has nothing to offer.Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him.

I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be? https://t.co/taSpWIFT1bWe need a president who listens. https://t.co/aBdClOSDYwIt’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress — and we have that chance once again. We’re not just going to rebuild this nation — we’re going to transform it. 

There is nothing we can’t do if we do it together. https://t.co/iozMdaLtAwIf we stand together, we will rise stronger than before. A more equal, more just, more hopeful nation — closer to that more perfect union we must always strive to be.I ask all of America — not to deny our pain or cover it over — but to use it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy.If the Senate has time to confirm Donald Trump’s unqualified judicial nominees, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution’s promise of equal protection under the law.

No more excuses. No more delays.When 100,000 Americans died because of his incompetent leadership, this president golfed.

When Americans peacefully protested outside the White House, this president tear-gassed them for a photo-op.

Donald Trump was elected to serve us all — but he only looks out for himself.The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. I won’t either.

But I promise you this: I won’t traffic in fear and division or fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country — not use them for political gain. https://t.co/TfNaoMRZQpThat’s what the presidency is: a duty of care — to all of us, not just our voters, not just our donors, but all of us. https://t.co/rWHywb5cHV“I can’t breathe.”
 
George Floyd’s last words. But they didn’t die with him. They’re still being heard. They’re echoing across this nation.
 
It’s a wake-up call for all of us. https://t.co/q6kARnpJqUJulián — I made a promise to George's family that he wouldn't just become another hashtag. We're going to tackle this head on — and we're going to need your help to do it. Grateful for your support. https://t.co/D0Ssv4hU2SI’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.

Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important—who we want to be. It’s all at stake.
 
That is truer today than ever. And it’s in this urgency we can find the path forward.The President held up a bible at St. John’s church yesterday. If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something: 

That we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. 

That’s hard work. But it’s the work of America.A country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together, leadership that can recognize the pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time.Let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes.  This morning I'm speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on where we are and where we need to go. Tune in: https://t.co/1bSdeXp8RcPride is a global movement of love, self-expression, and community — resilient in the face of oppression and fear and hopeful for a better future. This month, let us recommit to those principles and remain steadfast in the fight for justice and equality. https://t.co/cNxsmEFW6RHe's using the American military against the American people.

He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.

For a photo.

For our children, for the very soul of our country, we must defeat him. But I mean it when I say this: we can only do it together. https://t.co/G1yE67q9NzIn this moment, the very soul of America is at stake.
 
We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.
 
We have to finally make real the American promise: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives.Leaders listen. https://t.co/FPSJP4Fkn3After another night of unrest in America, I’m hosting a virtual roundtable with mayors from across the country to discuss where we go from here. Tune in: https://t.co/qyXzbDdSBqWe are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. 

As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington. https://t.co/0h2ApbKT0CWe are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUFTrump’s Tantrum Diplomacy is eroding U.S. credibility on the international stage. Withdrawing from @WHO during a global pandemic is a recipe for disaster and increases the cost of the American response. We must instead rally the world to confront COVID-19. https://t.co/rIlUewZNyIIf we are complacent, if we are silent, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.

None of us can turn away. We all have an obligation to speak out.You can't defeat bigotry; it only hides. And when leaders give it oxygen — as Donald Trump has done — it comes roaring back.

We all have a moral obligation to stand up, speak out, and hold people accountable. https://t.co/vES2aIXVGlToday, in lifting our ambitions and our imaginations to the heavens, the United States has once more reshaped the future of space travel. https://t.co/AskxceOJJUEvery day that Donald Trump spends in the White House, he further debases the values and ideals of our nation. He is wholly unfit to be president. https://t.co/Fq90hSLuLzThis is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.

This is a national crisis — and we need real leadership right now.We are a country with an open wound.

None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words — “I can’t breathe” — and do nothing.

We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. https://t.co/veodlR1UYUIt’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.

It’s time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation.

We need justice for George Floyd.Tune in as I address the unfolding situation in Minnesota and the killing of George Floyd: https://t.co/AKk14gGif5I will be speaking more about the events in Minnesota later today.I will not lift the President’s tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I’m furious, and you should be too.This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything.Enough.We can’t allow this crisis to exacerbate the disparities that plague our nation. https://t.co/QlV2tdEDfmWe’re months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have an effective national testing strategy.
 
I do: https://t.co/MTnecpzZgvOrdinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America — and we’re seeing it written every single day. It gives me hope. https://t.co/hK8AbPKZue100,000+ lives lost across the country.
1,700,000+ confirmed U.S. cases.
40,000,000+ unemployment claims filed.

Donald Trump has failed our nation.Today, we learned that another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new claims since this crisis began to more than 40 million. It's just the latest evidence of Donald Trump’s utter failure of leadership. https://t.co/YSHGLBdMLGThirty years ago, I proudly cosponsored the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an enormous step forward, but there's more work to do. So today, I’m releasing my plan to achieve full participation and equality for people with disabilities: https://t.co/psuNvKzYejThe hard truth is that this crisis didn’t have to be this bad.Two tweets from the same day in October. https://t.co/rsSslLCsTWEvery day Donald Trump proves how unfit he is to lead our nation. https://t.co/zymzZw8619Presidents are supposed to lead by example — and every day Donald Trump proves how incapable he is of doing that. https://t.co/B0t497xxHcGeorge Floyd’s life mattered. https://t.co/1XoadyjRWw.@DrBiden and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Larry Kramer, an American hero. Through his activism, Larry taught us all how to speak up and demand our government do its job. His outspokenness raised our consciousness on HIV/AIDS and saved countless lives. https://t.co/ZdFE2Pq32wThere are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they're forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief. Today is one of those moments. 100,000 lives have now been lost to this virus.

To those hurting, I'm so sorry for your loss. The nation grieves with you. https://t.co/SBBRKV4mPZOver the last few months, countless Asian Americans have been threatened, attacked, and blamed for COVID-19. They've cruelly been made the scapegoat by the most powerful man on the planet, President Trump. It has to end.

Read more from @TammyforIL and me: https://t.co/W7h54A91U9We’re in the middle of a global pandemic — and not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he’s also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.

It’s morally reprehensible.Tune in now as @TomWolfPA joins me for a conversation on how COVID-19 is impacting states: https://t.co/3gMLagg78XThis morning, I’ll be joined by @TomWolfPA for a conversation on how COVID-19 is making an impact on states. 

Tune in live at 10:30AM EDT: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/D6Ewy1xm78Last year California passed #AB5, affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.

Now, gig economy giants are trying to gut the law and exempt their workers. It's unacceptable.

I urge Californians to vote no on the initiative this November.George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. His life mattered.

I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved — they must be held responsible for their egregious actions. The FBI should conduct a thorough investigation. https://t.co/n1tdiUba0xWear a mask.Donald Trump's wealthy donors got tens of millions of dollars in relief, while countless small businesses were turned away. It's no wonder he didn't want any oversight.

We need a government that works for all — not just the super-wealthy.The truth is asking for money is the worst part of running for president—especially in times as tough as these. But we’re coming up on our end of month fundraising deadline, and I need your help to ensure we hit our goal.

If you can, please chip in today: https://t.co/af28OgWn2G1 in 4 U.S. workers has filed for unemployment benefits in the last 10 weeks. It’s a crisis unlike anything we’ve seen in our lifetime — and the Trump Administration is failing to do enough to help.Folks, today we’re launching #League46⚾️ — a next generation coalition ready to make Donald Trump a one-term president. We've got unlimited capacity to create change — and together, we’re going to transform this country.

Join today: https://t.co/Rnwttcaugo https://t.co/Dbez4mtrwxSo much of this could have been prevented if we had a president who listened to someone other than himself.We are months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a comprehensive plan when it comes to COVID-19 or the economy. It's unacceptable. I released a detailed plan laying out what I would do months ago, and have built on it since. Take a look: https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCDThere’s not a single thing the American people can’t do if we do it together.We have always been able to take crises and turn them into opportunities — and we have the chance to do that once again. If we match our ambitions to the scale of the challenges we face, we can and will transform our country for generations to come.This ruling goes a long way toward protecting the sacred right to vote, but there's still work to do. We've got to ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voice heard at the ballot box. https://t.co/yMzAz3NU5uTo all the members of our military and our military families, especially those who have lost their service member, thank you. We owe you. We can never lessen the magnitude of your loss, but this I can promise you: we will never forget. #MemorialDay https://t.co/b5vDrYiPL5The presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart. It requires taking on the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Donald Trump simply wasn’t prepared for that. I promise you I will be.Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and time is running out to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle the challenge head-on.Hunger today isn’t about scarcity — it’s about a massive failure in leadership. 

If I were President, I’d immediately work with @chefjoseandres to empower our restaurants to be part of the solution as families go hungry during the COVID-19 crisis. https://t.co/dGqSDgqXpMWe’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and the Trump Administration is trying to prevent people from getting health care. https://t.co/B46LlVfWaLFolks write letters to me asking all kinds of questions, but Jack's question on my favorite ice cream flavor might be the best one yet.

Here’s what I told him: https://t.co/GGlLFK1Q6S https://t.co/Hd5lTk1SlMMake no mistake: I believe our best days still lie ahead. We can and will transform this nation — together.Nearly 100,000 lives have been lost, and tens of millions are out of work.

Meanwhile, the president spent his day golfing. https://t.co/H1BVNtgVjAAs Ramadan draws to an end, @DrBiden and I want to wish a safe and warm celebration to our Muslim friends and neighbors. Even though we can't be all together to celebrate, we hope it is filled with joy, family, and success for the year to come. #EidMubarakThis is jarring — and a heartbreaking reminder that the death toll we see in the news is so much more than just a statistic. Every single one marks a future cut short and a family and community that will never be the same. @DrBiden and I are keeping them all in our hearts. https://t.co/4yJzsRdB6lDonald Trump has failed to live up to our trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans. It’s unacceptable.

I’ll make meaningful investments in Indian Country — including increasing funding for Indian Health Services and making that funding mandatory. https://t.co/JIObym7aXIRT @DougJones: While these two fight over their big mistakes let’s make sure Alabama doesn’t make one with either Sessions or a former foot…We can protect the sacred right to vote and protect public health at the same time.The hard truth is Donald Trump ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.

It’s one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history.36,000 Americans could be alive today if President Trump had acted sooner. Let's put that into perspective: https://t.co/i2bmqRe86rWe're in the midst of the worst economic crisis in our lifetime, and Senate Republicans continue to delay relief for the American people saying, "I don’t see the need right now." Unbelievable.

We've got to take back the Senate this November. https://t.co/ij73z7Oq9PAdi is an incredible young advocate for the transgender community. He also graduated high school today. We wanted to say congrats...with a couple friends! https://t.co/1bDml2YI8QChip in to help make it happen: https://t.co/63RkztugeC https://t.co/ud1RASKhzSNo worker’s life is worth getting a cheaper hamburger. Period. https://t.co/hMkO4ILgmxThink of how many small businesses could have been helped with the $47 million that went to private jet companies owned by wealthy Trump donors. It’s ridiculous.

We need a president who puts hardworking Americans ahead of the wealthy and well-connected. https://t.co/A7Pn17J6idWe will get through this, and we will come out stronger. I promise. https://t.co/qXIjeMuwbZIn announcing the intent to withdraw from the Open Skies Treaty, President Trump has doubled down on his short-sighted policy of going it alone and abandoning American leadership. https://t.co/mbO2EBCYJuI've said it before, and I'll say it again: No company pulling in billions of dollars in profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers.

It's time for Amazon to pay its fair share. https://t.co/rsfBvcjqvXJoin Andrew Yang to discuss the economic impact of COVID-19. Tune in now: https://t.co/bKZ6bvcfXvIn the middle of this crisis, President Trump is trying to cut food assistance. It’s morally bankrupt.

We should do everything in our power to ensure no one goes hungry in America.RT @TeamJoe: Friday brunch with @AndrewYang? Don’t mind if we do! 

Join @AndrewYang live at 12:15PM EDT as he discusses the economic impac…A president who can't handle a crisis is no president at all. https://t.co/c1vnz3dHspIt didn’t have to be this bad. The hard truth is that Donald Trump failed to take action, and it cost American lives. https://t.co/qhkliK1i5ZTurns out, it takes more than a tweet to implement a comprehensive national testing strategy. https://t.co/baC59RadI9I’m looking forward to joining my friend @StephenAtHome on the @colbertlateshow tonight. Check out some of my favorite moments from the last time I was on his show — and then make sure to tune in to CBS at 11:35 PM ET. https://t.co/KfG0ilRVqII don't usually Google myself, but I made an exception for @WIRED’s Autocomplete Interview. Check it out: https://t.co/viqeb85KjmDonald Trump’s inaction cost lives. https://t.co/Pdeb7HVCj3While we hope to soon return to some sense of normalcy in our lives, we cannot allow ourselves to return to the everyday gun violence that has plagued our past. We need to pass common-sense reforms and end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/mJGGDWg54BI promise you this: A Biden Administration will listen to scientists and heed their advice — not silence them. https://t.co/hV4HPOmGDVWhen I launched my campaign, I said we were in a battle for the soul of the nation — we’re seeing that soul on full display. Folks are reaching out to help one another and doing truly heroic things. It makes me so proud.This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. We need to ensure every single eligible American can safely make their voice heard this November. https://t.co/x7S9vkYwUIWe don't have a food shortage problem — we have a leadership problem. https://t.co/eFpJ8PGHGMDonald Trump is using a global health crisis as an excuse to deport children and continue separating families. It's heartless and un-American. People across the political spectrum rejected these policies before, and will do so again, because they know families belong together. https://t.co/xhd4PmvJsiFolks, I’m excited to share that we’re hosting a grassroots fundraiser with @PeteButtigieg. Grassroots donors are the backbone of our campaign — and I want to thank you for all your support.

Chip in any amount to join us Friday afternoon: https://t.co/B6JZ1XXuyzMy heart and Jill's go out to the people of Midland, Michigan, experiencing another crisis in the midst of this pandemic. https://t.co/8XR7XJpzndDonald Trump needs to do his job and implement a national testing strategy.From my home in Delaware to Milwaukee, Wisconsin — join us for a virtual rally at 3:30 PM CT: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/5vYn55VS6RDonald Trump has failed to provide for our nurses and doctors on the frontlines. Now he’s short-changing our troops and their families. Unacceptable. https://t.co/Q3s1MvHwQXNow more than ever, we need a president who will choose to unite rather than divide.When we emerge from this crisis, we can’t just go back to the way things were before. We need to take this country to a place we’ve never been. Where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone gets a full share of the American dream.Congratulations to Dr. @iingwen on the start of her second term. Taiwan’s thriving democracy and response to COVID-19 are an example to the world. America’s support for Taiwan must remain strong, principled, and bipartisan. https://t.co/82aw9TFh8zThe United States of America has always emerged stronger from every trial and tribulation — and we will again. We will overcome this.Fundamentally, this is about whose side the government is on and whether it is accountable to the American people. This is a case I will continue to make, and if elected president will deliver on. https://t.co/x19ZeMOz4vThat's exactly why @EWarren and I have called for more oversight. We need more conditions on corporations to ensure relief goes to their workers, not their CEOs. No $500 billion slush fund. No blank checks. The Trump Administration is prioritizing big corporations over workers.During today’s Senate Banking Committee hearing, Secretary @StevenMnuchin1 refused to require corporations benefiting from $500 billion in CARES Act funds to keep workers on their payrolls. @EWarren asked him several times, each time he ducked and refused.Today, @DrBiden and I are mourning the death of our dear friend, Annie Glenn. Her long life was filled with great love and great meaning, with purpose and her own brand of uncommon courage. https://t.co/JnAuBlF41P
