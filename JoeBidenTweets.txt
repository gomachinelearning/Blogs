I know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be. But ours is a union worth fighting for — and we are all called to the cause.

None of us can turn away. None of us can stay silent.
Donald Trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives — and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.
I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important — who we want to be. It’s all at stake.

That's the case we're making in our first TV ad of the general election: https://t.co/gGeSmBIIxA
On June 19, 1865, in Galveston, TX, the last enslaved African Americans were finally given notice of their freedom. 155 years later, we're still on the long road to equality, equity, and fairness for all.

We can't rest until the promise of this nation is fulfilled. #Juneteenth https://t.co/ZHOH8Hz57H
#Juneteenth reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity—but it's also a reminder of our ability to change. Together, we can lay the roots of real and lasting justice, and become the extraordinary nation that was promised to all.
Amy — from the moment you announced you were running for president in a snowstorm, it wasn't hard to see you had the grit and determination to do anything you set your mind to. You know how to get things done. With your help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump. https://t.co/4kquPZtSV9
Climate change is linked to increased pregnancy risks — and heartbreakingly, Black mothers are being hit the hardest. As President, I'll work every day to tackle the climate crisis head-on and root out injustice. Because they are intertwined. https://t.co/egmxpkXoLc
To all the Dreamers who make our country better and stronger every single day: Thank you. This country needs you. #HomeIsHere https://t.co/VZPVqY1cgq
The decisions of the last few days should remind us all of the immense power of the Supreme Court — and the generational impact its justices can have.

We have the power to shape the Court's future this November — and we can’t forget that.
I'm ready on day one. After more than three years in office, why isn't Donald Trump ready? https://t.co/ksgxTsG7QK
Dreamers are Americans. Period.
Just like Donald Trump couldn’t wish COVID-19 away in March, and just like he couldn’t tweet it away in April — he can’t ignore it away in June. https://t.co/nOBnrL4rWi
Here’s my promise to you: On day one, I’ll send a bill to Congress that creates a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and 11 million undocumented people who are already strengthening our nation. It’s long overdue.
It didn’t have to be this bad. But we have a president who is more interested in taking a victory lap than he is in doing the work needed to solve this crisis.

We need a president who will put the American people first — and actually do the work. https://t.co/Lk1GDmSmAM
Thanks, Barack. You're right — and we won't stop until every Dreamer feels safe in this country. https://t.co/fVoZRhabRy
Donald Trump inherited a growing economy from President Obama and me. And just like everything else he has inherited in his life, he has squandered it. https://t.co/kxBBzhxvxc
The Supreme Court’s ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored. And as President, I will get to work immediately to make it permanent. https://t.co/xKkCp4P9Ff
Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy — but he has surrendered the fight.

Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated.
Vice President Pence claimed success because COVID-19 deaths are “down to” fewer than 750 a day.

That's more than 20,000 a month — and they're self-congratulating? Unbelievable.

It may be good enough for President Trump, but it will never be acceptable if I am President. https://t.co/9h08nxjC6k
I’m proud to stand with folks across the country participating in today’s #WorkersFirst Caravan. Senate Republicans need to pass the #HeroesAct now and take action to root out systemic racism. https://t.co/s5zCJBXYIp
If John Bolton's accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of Donald Trump’s sacred duty to the American people to protect America’s interests and defend our values.
Donald Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action necessary to contain it — and now in many states, COVID cases are on the rise again.

This president has failed to lead our nation. https://t.co/1fdu8WMeN5
Five years ago, nine good souls were ripped from this world — killed by hate and white supremacy. Today, we honor the memory of the Emanuel Nine and the unspeakable grace of those they left behind. https://t.co/zpVG2ak8aK
I'm in Darby, Pennsylvania, to discuss how we can make sure the country's reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in: https://t.co/VaCPc32w9A
The truth of our nation is that too often the color of your skin alone can endanger your life and, for far too long, systemic racism has oppressed communities of color in the United States.

It has to change.
We need a president who chooses unity over division.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is running the most corrupt administration in modern American history. https://t.co/6Uxn50HzH9
We have the power to write the future we want for this country. One where health care is a right, we lead the world in the fight against climate change, we end our gun violence epidemic, and our government works for all — not just the powerful.

Let’s do it together.
We can’t forget that in the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is trying to gut Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.
Systemic racism pervades every part of our society, including law enforcement — and we have to do the hard work to root it out. In January, I sat down with Jake, a field organizer on our campaign, to listen to what he had to say and discuss how we can move forward: https://t.co/mVkxpWxbod
This virus won’t just go away because you want it to, Mr. President. It’s time for you to step up and do your job.
Los Dreamers son estadounidenses. Trump les quitó la protección que lograron con tanto esfuerzo. Esto es inaceptable. El primer día de mi presidencia enviaré un proyecto de ley al Congreso que protegerá a los beneficiarios de DACA de la deportación. https://t.co/mGmTA03HEq
LGBTQ+ rights are human rights. Period.
Folks, I’ve got some big news: Next week, I’m getting together with my friend and former boss, President @BarackObama, for a virtual grassroots fundraiser. We would love to see you there.
 
Chip in now to get your ticket: https://t.co/UD3RHHKIw1
Dreamers are Americans. But Trump's ripped away the hard-won protections of DACA recipients, throwing their lives into upheaval. It’s unacceptable, and on day one of my presidency I will protect them from deportation and send a bill to Congress. https://t.co/YlvFuCaTrZ
I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.
 
It's up to all of us to do the hard work to ensure the American ideal finally wins out. https://t.co/iUyi82zXN7
I'm grateful for @PPact's support and proud to stand with them in this fight. As president, I’m going to do everything in my power to expand access to quality, affordable health care — including reproductive health care. https://t.co/dYHAOGlfSQ
Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he does bear full responsibility for his slow, uncoordinated, bungled response. https://t.co/IUdWpqZncn
Race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities. We need to tackle systemic racism head-on and ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American dream.

Here’s what I would do as president: https://t.co/Ni1rAm8DNZ
Today's decision is another step in our march toward equality for all. The Supreme Court has confirmed the simple but profoundly American idea that every human being should be treated with respect. But we're not done. https://t.co/Bz4SMA9tgb
After reports of wealthy Trump donors getting millions in relief meant for small businesses, the administration is now refusing to disclose where the PPP money went. It's unacceptable.

The American people deserve answers. https://t.co/F2n3PA7RZU
In every corner of the country, people are raising their voices and demanding justice. It gives me so much hope.

Together, we’re going to transform this nation and ensure justice finally rings out for all.
We need a president who heals — not one who fans the flames of hate.
 
We need a president who unites — not one who sows further discord for political gain.
 
We need a president who leads the way with a steady hand — not one who incites violence with his erratic tweets.
We’re facing some of the greatest challenges in our nation’s history — and it’s clear Donald Trump isn’t up for the job.

We need real leadership, right now.
We have to ensure every worker called back on the job has access to regular, reliable COVID-19 testing and effective personal protective equipment. https://t.co/lDPQP3jZkw
We need a president who will fight to further LGBTQ+ equality — not roll back the hard-won progress we've already made.
We need real policing reform — and we need it now. https://t.co/HkBvD8QsmL
Our nation is at an inflection point. We can't go back to the way things were before — we have to take a bold step forward and usher in a new era of equality and opportunity.

We can do it, together.
Here's my promise to you: I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our nation — not use them for political gain.

We shouldn’t accept anything less from an American president. https://t.co/I0r60NW4SU
We need a national ban on chokeholds. Now.
I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. That is truer today than ever. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation.
 
We can’t let that happen.
In light of Donald Trump's inhumane reversal of protections for transgender people, I want to share a conversation I had a few weeks ago. Adi deserves to be treated with the same respect and dignity as anyone else. Period. https://t.co/nr1u0vOvog
On the fourth anniversary of Pulse.
In the middle of Pride month.
During a global pandemic.

Donald Trump's cruelty truly knows no bounds. We have to defeat him this November. https://t.co/YAy4ZGxxyD
Two years after Trump's Singapore meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the U.S. and our allies are less safe and Kim's arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles keeps growing. Photo-ops and love letters are no substitute for deterrence and principled diplomacy. https://t.co/YfaCdlwJ8S
Medgar Evers once said, "freedom has never been free." On this day in 1963, he paid the ultimate price in pursuit of freedom for his brothers and sisters. He was gunned down fighting to end racial injustice. We must honor him by carrying forward that cause in our own lives today.
Four years ago today, 49 lives were cut short in an act of unspeakable terrorism at Pulse nightclub. As we remember those we lost — including so many in the LGBTQ+ and Hispanic communities — we have to double down on our efforts to #HonorThemWithAction. https://t.co/TKaZ4M7IFF
We need real policing reform, and we need it now. Congress should immediately:

- Outlaw chokeholds
- Improve oversight and accountability
- Create a model use of force standard
- Stop the transfer of weapons of war to local police forces
Donald Trump forgot about COVID-19, but COVID-19 didn’t forget about us. 

The President couldn’t wish away the virus in April, he couldn’t tweet it away in May, and he can’t ignore it away in June.
Our country is crying out for leadership that Donald Trump can’t deliver. https://t.co/QHvUdgg6Io
We need a president who chooses hope over fear.
We can't let history repeat itself — Facebook needs to act now to stop the spread of disinformation and protect our elections. Watch my deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield break down what's happening and how you can help us fix it: https://t.co/WYMMAWkuLZ https://t.co/OGG2wwtW2P
COVID-19 can affect anyone, anywhere — but it doesn't impact every community equally. Watch as Dr. Ebony Jade Hilton explains how it’s impacting communities of color: https://t.co/3uuXEsfyv4
While the president was spiking the football and taking a victory lap, another 1.5 million Americans filed new unemployment claims last week.
 
He is completely oblivious to what's really happening in this country — and hardworking Americans are paying the price. https://t.co/AglBowCtKc
We have to ensure our economic reopening is safe and strong — and builds the foundation for an economy that works for everyone. Today, I'm releasing my plan to make that happen: https://t.co/v6hImc0J3q
We have to make sure our economic reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in for a roundtable discussion on how we can make that happen: https://t.co/7WIbtob6WE

With less than 150 days until Election Day, the stakes couldn't be higher. We've got to fix Facebook to protect our democracy and ensure fair elections.
 
If you agree, sign the open letter today to demand Facebook take action. #MoveFastFixIt https://t.co/6Hmta4UxS9
So far, Facebook has failed to enact any real reforms to stop the spread of disinformation on its platform. Time is running out.
 
Today, we're releasing an open letter demanding the company change its policies: https://t.co/S1WIQTsfEL
Folks, we saw in 2016 what can happen when social media platforms are left unchecked and allow disinformation to run rampant. It puts the very integrity of our elections at risk.
 
We simply cannot let it happen again in 2020.
It's in our darkest moments that we've produced some of our greatest progress — and we have that opportunity once again. Let's make this a moment of action to address systemic racism and propel our nation into an era of true equality and opportunity.
There is systemic racism not just in our law enforcement but also in housing, education, and everything we do — and we have to do the hard work to end it. https://t.co/w9H77Jbuqa
We have to make this an era of action — starting with real police reform. No more excuses. No more delays.
 
Add your name to demand Congress ban chokeholds — and pass real police reform — right now: https://t.co/Sa6sPy2BtS
This pandemic isn't just going to go away because you want it to, Mr. President. Step up and do your job before your negligence costs even more lives than it already has. https://t.co/L6QfV31eFQ

Nothing about the fights we're facing will be easy. Racism has been a fixture in our society for hundreds of years. 
 
But I’m ready to get to work on day one. We can’t accept anything less from an American president.
Donald Trump’s hate-filled, conspiracy-laden rhetoric is inflaming the racial divides in our country—but just fixing the way the president talks won’t cut it. We need to root out systemic racism and ensure Black Americans have a real shot to get ahead. https://t.co/FhgRNPjKR8
America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. We’ve never fully lived up to that promise — and we can’t rest until we finally do.
From ballot shortages and issues with machines to hours-long lines — what happened today in Georgia should enrage us all. We need to act now to prevent it from happening again in November. Our democracy depends on it. https://t.co/LLhBr8qVQw
Because of Donald Trump's negligence and incompetence:
 
- More than 110,000 people have died
- We have nearly 2 million cases of COVID-19
- Over 20 million Americans are out of work
 
And yet he’s patting himself on the back. Unbelievable.
Small businesses like Rafael's are the backbone of communities all across this nation. We have to do so much more to help them through this crisis. https://t.co/msi1oZ6P24

Let me be clear: We can't leave this moment and once again turn away and do nothing.
 
We need justice. We need action. We need reform.
Grief is a heavy burden to bear — and it's even harder with the eyes of the world watching. I know. But that burden is now a purpose — to change the world for the better in the name of George Floyd.

That's the message I shared with his loved ones during today's service: https://t.co/2LKJzwBUSO
My Dad used to say there's no greater sin than the abuse of power.

Whether it's an officer bloodying a peaceful protester or a President defending him with a conspiracy theory he saw on TV.

I'm a Catholic – just like Martin. Our faith says that we can't accept either.

This moment is a wake-up call for all of us. It's long past time we deal with systemic racism, growing economic inequality, and the denial of the promise of this nation to so many. https://t.co/IV4EVWAfRO
Donald Trump inherited the longest economic expansion in history from the Obama-Biden Administration, but like everything else he’s inherited, he has squandered it. https://t.co/395A6eJAzm

We're facing some of the greatest challenges in our history, and Donald Trump is patting himself on the back. He just has no idea what’s really going on in this country.
 
It's time for him to step out of his bunker and look around at the consequences of his words and actions.
American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending. But we have the power to write the future we want for this nation.

Don't let anyone tell you differently.
Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.
Our nation is at an inflection point. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics — or we can take the next great step forward. https://t.co/AbLAYAUsZx
These disparities have plagued our nation for far too long. It’s time we rebuild our country upon more just and equal foundations — and finally close race-based wealth and income gaps. https://t.co/KforFaypAP
We need to build an economy that rewards work — not just wealth. https://t.co/NANxlpk538
This isn’t about politics. This is about the future of our country. Grateful for your support, Secretary Powell. https://t.co/0xLPyXiIPb
The words of a president matter. And time and time again, Donald Trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart.
 
We cannot give him another four years in the White House.
We need to stand up as a nation — with the Black community and with all minority communities — and come together as one America. Because the pain is too immense for one community to bear alone.
 
It is the duty of every American to grapple with it — and grapple with it now.
I promised George Floyd's family that he wouldn’t just become another hashtag — and I intend to keep that promise.
 
We need justice. And we need real police reform to ensure this never occurs again.
To all those families who are scared, and hurting, and wondering what’s going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I won’t ever forget you. And I won’t be satisfied until this economy starts working for all of you. https://t.co/YxQ2OaeSyQ
Today, we honor those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, on the beachheads of Normandy. We must be a living memorial to their bravery and sacrifice—and recognize always that our strength is rooted in our fervid and unfailing defense of democratic rights and freedoms. #DDay
Today, the pain is so raw it can be hard to keep faith that justice is at hand or that we will ever achieve the more perfect union we all want. But ours is a union worth fighting for, and we are all called to the cause. 

No one can stay silent. https://t.co/nZjQdJGKbD
We're just 150 days out from Election Day, and the stakes have never been higher. We have to defeat Donald Trump, and once we do, we won’t just rebuild this country — we'll transform it. Together.
 
Help us make it happen: https://t.co/AflPBScS1L
Donald Trump was warned, but he failed to act. Now more than 20 million Americans are out of a job and paying the price. It didn’t have to be this bad. https://t.co/Hut7pquZUU
150 days.

Tonight, I’m thinking of Breonna Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer. Today should have been her daughter's birthday. I've talked a lot about turning pain into purpose. But for Breonna and Tamika, it’s on us to find purpose. Our country needs to act — now. https://t.co/Ql2SyMew76
Donald Trump still doesn’t get it. He’s out there spiking the football — completely oblivious to the tens of millions of people who are facing the greatest struggle of their lives. https://t.co/ZNbTRsdVdS
This #GunViolenceAwarenessDay, I am reflecting on the life of Hadiya Pendleton, whose murder inspired the #WearOrange movement.

The hard truth is that Black Americans are ten times more likely to die by gun homicide. It has to stop.
When it comes to this economic crisis, Donald Trump either doesn’t know what’s going on, or he just doesn’t care. https://t.co/db8axnf704
Donald Trump is dangerously unfit to lead our nation through this moment. But don't just take my word for it: https://t.co/eD9z51pXDQ
Let’s be clear about something: The depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of God — but to the failure of a President.
George Floyd’s last words, “I can’t breathe,” have echoed across our nation and around the world.

For the President to try to put any other words in his mouth is frankly despicable. https://t.co/8dWu78dtGP
Tune in as I speak about the latest jobs report and the state of the economy: https://t.co/pfELb1jmqa
Those who have worked the closest with Donald Trump know how unfit he is to serve as President. https://t.co/MQ7aOKGic0
It is long past time we made the promise of this nation real for all of our people.
We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us.
 
We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us.
 
We are a nation exhausted, but we will not allow our exhaustion to defeat us.
We can’t take four more years of this.
To everyone struggling with mental health—you're not alone. There is no shame in seeking help, and there shouldn't be any barriers in your way to getting that help.
 
Together, we can achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma. https://t.co/QXplsIwYTL
It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. And I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you.
We are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists.

"We do not need to militarize our response to protests. We need to unite around a common purpose." https://t.co/T0F5TEjwqe
I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.

It's up to all of us to create the America we know we can be. https://t.co/LNI2e3d3lz
More than 42 million Americans have now filed for unemployment in the last three months, and Black and Latino communities are being hit hardest. https://t.co/qXnKEf1JMF
There’s no time to waste — we need to get to work immediately on real police reform. Congressman @Hakeem_Jeffries has a bill to outlaw chokeholds. Congress should put it on President Trump’s desk in the next few days. Period. https://t.co/w8XkHwFcBt
The nation is crying out for leadership — but this president has nothing to offer.
Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him.

I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be? https://t.co/taSpWIFT1b
We need a president who listens. https://t.co/aBdClOSDYw
It’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress — and we have that chance once again. We’re not just going to rebuild this nation — we’re going to transform it. 

There is nothing we can’t do if we do it together. https://t.co/iozMdaLtAw
If we stand together, we will rise stronger than before. A more equal, more just, more hopeful nation — closer to that more perfect union we must always strive to be.
I ask all of America — not to deny our pain or cover it over — but to use it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy.
If the Senate has time to confirm Donald Trump’s unqualified judicial nominees, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution’s promise of equal protection under the law.

No more excuses. No more delays.
When 100,000 Americans died because of his incompetent leadership, this president golfed.

When Americans peacefully protested outside the White House, this president tear-gassed them for a photo-op.

Donald Trump was elected to serve us all — but he only looks out for himself.
The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. I won’t either.

But I promise you this: I won’t traffic in fear and division or fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country — not use them for political gain. https://t.co/TfNaoMRZQp
That’s what the presidency is: a duty of care — to all of us, not just our voters, not just our donors, but all of us. https://t.co/rWHywb5cHV
“I can’t breathe.”
 
George Floyd’s last words. But they didn’t die with him. They’re still being heard. They’re echoing across this nation.
 
It’s a wake-up call for all of us. https://t.co/q6kARnpJqU
Julián — I made a promise to George's family that he wouldn't just become another hashtag. We're going to tackle this head on — and we're going to need your help to do it. Grateful for your support. https://t.co/D0Ssv4hU2S
I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.

Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important—who we want to be. It’s all at stake.
 
That is truer today than ever. And it’s in this urgency we can find the path forward.
The President held up a bible at St. John’s church yesterday. If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something: 

That we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. 

That’s hard work. But it’s the work of America.
A country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together, leadership that can recognize the pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time.
Let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes.  This morning I'm speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on where we are and where we need to go. Tune in: https://t.co/1bSdeXp8Rc
Pride is a global movement of love, self-expression, and community — resilient in the face of oppression and fear and hopeful for a better future. This month, let us recommit to those principles and remain steadfast in the fight for justice and equality. https://t.co/cNxsmEFW6R

In this moment, the very soul of America is at stake.
 
We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being.
 
We have to finally make real the American promise: That all men and women are not only equal at creation, but throughout their lives.
Leaders listen. https://t.co/FPSJP4Fkn3
After another night of unrest in America, I’m hosting a virtual roundtable with mayors from across the country to discuss where we go from here. Tune in: https://t.co/qyXzbDdSBq
We are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. 

As President, I will help lead this conversation — and more importantly, I will listen, just as I did today visiting the site of last night's protests in Wilmington. https://t.co/0h2ApbKT0C
We are a nation in pain, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us. We are a nation enraged, but we cannot allow our rage to consume us. Please stay safe. Please take care of each other. https://t.co/Y224rANwUF
Trump’s Tantrum Diplomacy is eroding U.S. credibility on the international stage. Withdrawing from @WHO during a global pandemic is a recipe for disaster and increases the cost of the American response. We must instead rally the world to confront COVID-19. https://t.co/rIlUewZNyI
If we are complacent, if we are silent, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.

None of us can turn away. We all have an obligation to speak out.
You can't defeat bigotry; it only hides. And when leaders give it oxygen — as Donald Trump has done — it comes roaring back.

We all have a moral obligation to stand up, speak out, and hold people accountable. https://t.co/vES2aIXVGl
Today, in lifting our ambitions and our imaginations to the heavens, the United States has once more reshaped the future of space travel. https://t.co/AskxceOJJU
Every day that Donald Trump spends in the White House, he further debases the values and ideals of our nation. He is wholly unfit to be president. https://t.co/Fq90hSLuLz
This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.

This is a national crisis — and we need real leadership right now.
We are a country with an open wound.

None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words — “I can’t breathe” — and do nothing.

We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. https://t.co/veodlR1UYU
It’s time for us to take a hard look at uncomfortable truths.

It’s time for us to face the deep, open wound we have in this nation.

We need justice for George Floyd.
Tune in as I address the unfolding situation in Minnesota and the killing of George Floyd: https://t.co/AKk14gGif5
I will be speaking more about the events in Minnesota later today.
I will not lift the President’s tweet. I will not give him that amplification. But he is calling for violence against American citizens during a moment of pain for so many. I’m furious, and you should be too.
This is not abstract: a black reporter was arrested while doing his job this morning, while the white police officer who killed George Floyd remains free. I am glad swift action was taken, but this, to me, says everything.
Enough.
We can’t allow this crisis to exacerbate the disparities that plague our nation. https://t.co/QlV2tdEDfm
We’re months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have an effective national testing strategy.
 
I do: https://t.co/MTnecpzZgv
Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. That's the story of America — and we’re seeing it written every single day. It gives me hope. https://t.co/hK8AbPKZue
100,000+ lives lost across the country.
1,700,000+ confirmed U.S. cases.
40,000,000+ unemployment claims filed.

Donald Trump has failed our nation.
Today, we learned that another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new claims since this crisis began to more than 40 million. It's just the latest evidence of Donald Trump’s utter failure of leadership. https://t.co/YSHGLBdMLG
Thirty years ago, I proudly cosponsored the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an enormous step forward, but there's more work to do. So today, I’m releasing my plan to achieve full participation and equality for people with disabilities: https://t.co/psuNvKzYej
The hard truth is that this crisis didn’t have to be this bad.
Two tweets from the same day in October. https://t.co/rsSslLCsTW
Every day Donald Trump proves how unfit he is to lead our nation. https://t.co/zymzZw8619
Presidents are supposed to lead by example — and every day Donald Trump proves how incapable he is of doing that. https://t.co/B0t497xxHc
George Floyd’s life mattered. https://t.co/1XoadyjRWw
.@DrBiden and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Larry Kramer, an American hero. Through his activism, Larry taught us all how to speak up and demand our government do its job. His outspokenness raised our consciousness on HIV/AIDS and saved countless lives. https://t.co/ZdFE2Pq32w
There are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they're forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief. Today is one of those moments. 100,000 lives have now been lost to this virus.

To those hurting, I'm so sorry for your loss. The nation grieves with you. https://t.co/SBBRKV4mPZ
Over the last few months, countless Asian Americans have been threatened, attacked, and blamed for COVID-19. They've cruelly been made the scapegoat by the most powerful man on the planet, President Trump. It has to end.

We’re in the middle of a global pandemic — and not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he’s also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.

It’s morally reprehensible.
Tune in now as @TomWolfPA joins me for a conversation on how COVID-19 is impacting states: https://t.co/3gMLagg78X
This morning, I’ll be joined by @TomWolfPA for a conversation on how COVID-19 is making an impact on states. 

Tune in live at 10:30AM EDT: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/D6Ewy1xm78
Last year California passed #AB5, affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.

Now, gig economy giants are trying to gut the law and exempt their workers. It's unacceptable.

I urge Californians to vote no on the initiative this November.
George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. His life mattered.

I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved — they must be held responsible for their egregious actions. The FBI should conduct a thorough investigation. https://t.co/n1tdiUba0x
Wear a mask.
Donald Trump's wealthy donors got tens of millions of dollars in relief, while countless small businesses were turned away. It's no wonder he didn't want any oversight.

We need a government that works for all — not just the super-wealthy.
The truth is asking for money is the worst part of running for president—especially in times as tough as these. But we’re coming up on our end of month fundraising deadline, and I need your help to ensure we hit our goal.

If you can, please chip in today: https://t.co/af28OgWn2G
1 in 4 U.S. workers has filed for unemployment benefits in the last 10 weeks. It’s a crisis unlike anything we’ve seen in our lifetime — and the Trump Administration is failing to do enough to help.
Folks, today we’re launching #League46⚾️ — a next generation coalition ready to make Donald Trump a one-term president. We've got unlimited capacity to create change — and together, we’re going to transform this country.

Join today: https://t.co/Rnwttcaugo https://t.co/Dbez4mtrwx
So much of this could have been prevented if we had a president who listened to someone other than himself.
We are months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a comprehensive plan when it comes to COVID-19 or the economy. It's unacceptable. I released a detailed plan laying out what I would do months ago, and have built on it since. Take a look: https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD
There’s not a single thing the American people can’t do if we do it together.
We have always been able to take crises and turn them into opportunities — and we have the chance to do that once again. If we match our ambitions to the scale of the challenges we face, we can and will transform our country for generations to come.
This ruling goes a long way toward protecting the sacred right to vote, but there's still work to do. We've got to ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voice heard at the ballot box. https://t.co/yMzAz3NU5u
To all the members of our military and our military families, especially those who have lost their service member, thank you. We owe you. We can never lessen the magnitude of your loss, but this I can promise you: we will never forget. #MemorialDay https://t.co/b5vDrYiPL5
The presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart. It requires taking on the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Donald Trump simply wasn’t prepared for that. I promise you I will be.
Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and time is running out to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and tackle the challenge head-on.
Hunger today isn’t about scarcity — it’s about a massive failure in leadership. 

If I were President, I’d immediately work with @chefjoseandres to empower our restaurants to be part of the solution as families go hungry during the COVID-19 crisis. https://t.co/dGqSDgqXpM
We’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and the Trump Administration is trying to prevent people from getting health care. https://t.co/B46LlVfWaL
Folks write letters to me asking all kinds of questions, but Jack's question on my favorite ice cream flavor might be the best one yet.

Here’s what I told him: https://t.co/GGlLFK1Q6S https://t.co/Hd5lTk1SlM
Make no mistake: I believe our best days still lie ahead. We can and will transform this nation — together.
